Welcome to BDM, short for Better Drop Market. We specialize in providing direct messaging and advertising services to individuals who are dropshipping. We are a young and dynamic team founded in March 2021 by two driven individuals with a passion for creativity and innovation.

At our core, we believe that the old clich√©d method of advertising is beginning to fade out, being replaced by new ways to approach customers. If you don't prefer trying a new method of advertising that is yet to be proven completely, you can choose our other services where we handle all the burden of advertising, leaving you with no hassle whatsoever, e.g., advertising using Google Ads, which is a proven and effective method that has brought numerous companies to the spotlight, boosting their sales by an incomprehensible margin.

Here is a little about us. One of us takes care of all the technological stuff like APIs and making this website, and the other takes care of all the business. We've known each other for about 6 years now 

Whether you're just starting out in dropshipping or you're an established player looking to expand your customer base, our customized solutions are tailored to meet your specific needs and requirements. We use the latest technology and innovative approaches to deliver exceptional results that help you stand out in a crowded marketplace.

We take pride in our ability to provide high-quality services that are affordable and accessible to everyone. Get in touch with us today to learn more about how we can help you take your dropshipping business to the next level with our direct messaging and advertising services.
